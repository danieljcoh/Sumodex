	<!-- SUMO RULESET -->
		<button class="accordion">Sumo Ruleset</button>
		<div class="panel sumo-ruleset-container">
			<div class="sumo-ruleset-body">
				<div>
					<br>
					<p>Sumo Tournaments last 15 days, where everyday, each Rikishi (also known as a Sumo Wrestler) will need to wrestle another Sumo wrestler. 
					There will be always be one winner and one loser and there are never any ties. The Rikishi with the most wins at the end of the 
					15 days is declared the winner. If multiple Rikishi are tied with wins, then tie-breaker matches ensue on the final day to determine the tournament champion.</p>
		
					<br>
						<p>The matches, also referred to as 'bouts' take place in a four-meter wide clay stage called a "dohyo", where the Rikishi have to make their opponent 
						either leave the dohyo or have a body part other than the soles of their feet touch the ground. If a Rikishi is able to do any of the aforementioned, 
						the referee, also known as the, Gyoji, will point to the winners side of the dohyo and the match will be concluded.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The Gyoji: Also known as the referee in Sumo matches stands in the dohyo with the Rikishi and commands things such as if the Wrestlers
						had an acceptable start, and which Wrestler was the first to lose. These Gyoji are usually in colorful robes to stand out from the Wrestlers sometimes colorful miwashi belts. 
						Gyoji's hold a wooden fan in their hands which they use to point to the winner. There are different ranks of Gyoji, where the highest rank of Gyoji
						is defined by their beautiful silk robes and purple colorings which is the color of Japanese nobility.</p>
						<div id="gyoji-img"><p>The Gyoji</p></div>
						<br>
						<p>If for any reason the Shimpan (the judges in black attire sitting at the edges of the dohyo), disagree with the Gyoji's call for winner, they will call a 
						"Mono-ii", which is a discussion held amongst themselves and the Gyoji where they review each other's perspective and the video tapes to determin if the call
						was accurate.</p>
						<p>If for any reason the Shimpan are unable to determine a winner, such as both Rikishi leaving the dohyo at the same time, the judges will call a 
						Torinaoshi, which is where the Wrestlers will have to redo the entire bout, including the Pre-Match Rituals.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Wrestlers start the match with a Pre-Match Ritual (which is described more below) but afterwards, the wrestlers face off on equal sides of the dohyo,
						where they will both squat and lay down their fists. Once both Rikishi touch the ground with their fists, the bout commences. 
						If a wrestler starts the match without touching their hands down the Gyoji will call a "Matta" (which is a name for a false start) and they must start again.</p>
						<br>
						<p>There is no time limit for the bouts and some matches have been known to last four seconds, others have been known to last four minutes.</p>

		<!-- RANKINGS -->
		<div class="rankings-container">
			<h3>Rankings</h3>
				<br>
					<p>There are ten ranks in professional Sumo Wrestling. A Rikishi's placement in one of those ranks is determined by their wins and loses throughout a Basho. 
					They can be promoted or demoted accordingly depending on their scores.
					The top five ranks are known as "Makuuchi" or "TOP Division" where the matches are Televized and the salaries are way higher than lower ranks.
					The ultimate goal of many Rikishi is to become a Yokozuna but in order to do that Wrestlers must either win two tournaments in a row at the rank
					of Ozeki or do something of equivalent performance, and have the Unanimous vote of the Yokozuna deliberation coucil of the Japan Sumo Association.
					This would then allow you to be crowned either a Yokozuna or a Grand Champion. Yokozuna are usually differentiated by their white miwashi belts they wear
					before tournaments. Being a Yokozuna brings a lot of fame throughout Japan because it shows that you are one of the best Sumo Wrestlers on the planet.</p>

						<p>Sumo Wrestling is Japan's oldest sport dating back over 2000 years ago but didn't gain real cultural significance until about 700AD,
						also known as the Nara Period (710AD - 794AD) where Sumo became an event conducted at the Imperial Court, and bouts were performed in 
						front of the Emperor.</p>
						<p>Sumo took its present form in the Edo period (1603AD - 1868AD). Matches were held to raise money to construct shrines and temples or to 
						replace bridges, and the professional Sumo Wrestler was born. A sport that was once enjoyed only by the rich and powerful became popular 
						among the masses. Sumo events were often held in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, and the sport's popularity grew exponentially. 
						The government of the time, though, disapproved of fighting and often issued orders banning Sumo.</p>
						<p>For this reason, the organizers of Sumo decided on a set of rules, including the creation of a list of 48 legal moves and the 
						round ring that is still used today.
						As for today, many aspects of old Japan remain in Sumo. Top knot hairstyles, traditional dress, and ancient customs prove that Sumo is more than just a sport; 
						it's a living example of traditional Japanese culture.</p>

				<!-- PREMATCH RITUAL -->
				<div class="prematch-ritual-container">	
					<h1>Pre-match Ritual</h1>
					<div class="prematch-ritual-text">
						<p>Back in the beginning of Sumo Wrestling. Sumo began as a violent sport. Men beating up other men for the sport of impressing the Emperor.
						Overtime a belief began that because of the violence that took place in the dohyo, evil spirits would be waiting within the dohyo to prey on whoever entered; to cause injury.
						To combat this, Wrestlers and Founders established pre-match rituals that had a series of purposes which included but were not limited to:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Cleansing their mouths with sacred water. The same sacred water that is drunk at shrines when visited</li>
								<li>Showing their opponent that fairness is important to both Wrestlers and that no one will cheat or is "hiding weapons"</li>
								<li>Throwing salt in the dohyo to purify it so that the wrestlers can prevent injuries caused by spirits</li>
								<li>Together stomping out evil spirits that may be waiting in the dohyo with the Wrestlers</li>
								<li>Also, more presently, Wrestlers use this time to psych up their fans in the audience or to intimidate their opponent</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Before a bout, people will walk along the perimeter of the dohyo holding giant and sometimes colorful signs. These are sponsors. They pay money to show their
							signs at the Sumo bouts sponsoring a certain Rikishi, which if they win that money gets turned into prize money. Prize money is given to Wrestlers at the end of a bout,
							if they've won, within a stack of white envelopes.</p>
